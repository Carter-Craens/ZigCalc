# Zig Calculator

A starting implementation for a command-line calculator starting with simple arithmetic operations (add/sub/mult/div/()).

The initial plan has been complete, and was to learn some Zig basics. The plan for further expansion is as follows:
- Trigonometric operations
- Complex numbers
- Algebraic ability "find x"
- Proper test suite
